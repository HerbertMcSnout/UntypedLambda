-- Notice that even though the normal form of lazy1 is infinitely large,
-- when we run `bin/bohm --with examples/bohm-inf.lam` with lazy1 and lazy2
-- we still get a finite result because the path to the difference does not
-- run through the infinite part of the term

lazy1 = \x y. x
lazy2 = \x y. y
